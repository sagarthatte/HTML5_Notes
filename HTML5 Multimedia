//Notes for HTML5 Week 2 - Multimedia

* <video> element
	- <video> element is one of the two "Flash killers" (the other is <canvas>). 
	- Designed to replace horrible things like embedded flash objects.
	
Before HTML5, how did we embed videos?
	
    <object width="425" height="344">
       <param name="movie"
              value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9sEI1AUFJKw&hl=en_GB&fs=1&">
       </param>
       <param name="allowFullScreen"   value="true"></param>
       <param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param>
       <embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9sEI1AUFJKw&hl=en_GB&fs=1&"
              type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
              allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"
              width="425" height="344">
       </embed>
    </object>
    
    - Before HTML5, this was the only way to embed videos. Embedding flash player videos, made it impossible to watch on some mobile platforms. (Apple devices)
    
    After HTML5:
    	- The new technique is simpler and better.
    	
    <video controls autoplay> 
		<!-- I have three versions of the video encoded with
		     different codecs.  The browser will automatically
		     choose the first one it knows it can play. --> 
		<source src=http://html5doctor.com/demos/video-canvas-magic/video.webm type=video/webm> 
		<source src=http://html5doctor.com/demos/video-canvas-magic/video.ogg type=video/ogg> 
		<source src=http://html5doctor.com/demos/video-canvas-magic/video.mp4 type=video/mp4> 
	</video>
	
    Note:
    	1. 'controls' attribute indicates that control panel with play/stop/volume/progress is displayed.
    	2. Usually, browser will use the first format it recognizes. Some browsers use a heuristic approach for a
    		preferred format.
    	3. <video> element is a DOM member, so CSS3 styling, and transformations can be applied, as well as
    		manipulation using DOM API. (to be discussed in more detail later).
    		
    - Most current browsers support the <VIDEO> element.(except Opera Mini and IE8.).
    
    **RESTRICTION**
    	- Cannot embed YOUTUBE or DAILYMOTION video using <video> element.
    	- This is due to commercial reasons, and because advertising is auto added to videos.
    	- Need to embed an <iframe> that will render HTML5 videos in your web page.
    	
	- EXAMPLE with a YouTube video:

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZH1XOsv8Oyo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>

	- CODEC SUPPORT
		- Not the same from one browser to other. Since 2012, browsers have been updated in this context.
		- To check codec support, visit http://ie.microsoft.com/TEStdrive/Graphics/VideoFormatSupport/Default.html
		- Recommended codec working for all browsers, as of 2015
			H264/mp4
		- Recommended method to target large audience, is to encode videos using major supported formats.
