-- MINIMAL HTML DOCUMENT----------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>Page Title</title>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
	<script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<!-- Random content -->
</body>
</html>
------------------------------------------

- No quotes needed for most attribute values, if an attribute value is made of a single word, and is alphanumeric.
- No closing tags needed for most html elements.

New Structural Elements
- Currently in HTML, "parts" are implemented by relying heavily on <div> and <span> with different id and attributes, as also CSS and Javascript.

Disadvantages/ Limitations of this approach:
- id and class names might differ from one developer to other, and so on.
- Even with same id and class names, css rules may be different.
- JavaScript libraries become heavier over the years.
- Web pages become code heavy as well.
- These elements can not be handled by Web browser natively.

To overcome these limitations, as also based on surveys for commonly used id's and class names all over the WWW, new elements are added to HTML5 set.

1. <header> instead of <div class="header"> -->Typically header of a web site, that appears on top of each page, or a header of a long <article> or long <section>.
2. <aside> instead of <div class="aside"> -->Section whose content is not directly related to main content surrounding it, but provides additional information.
3. <footer> --> Contains the footer of a site, a long <article> or a long <section>/
4. <nav> --> Section containing the main navigation links (within document or to other pages).
5. <article> --> Independent content, that can be individually extracted from document, and alienated, without compromising the understanding of subject. (example: Blog Post).
6. <section> --> Generic section used to group different articles for various purposes. OR to definte the different sections of single article. Generally used with a <header>
7. <time> --> Used to mark up time and dates.
8. <figure>, <figcaption> --> To encapsulate a figure as a single term, and contains a caption for figure, respectively.
9. <main> --> Represents main content of body/document/application. This area consists of content directly related to, or expands on central topic of document.There can only be one <main> element in a document.
